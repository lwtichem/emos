### Reproducibility

Some materials to get acquinted with the topic

#### The reproducibility crisis

- [Ten famous psychology findings that are difficult to  replicate](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/) Or better: to _reproduce_.
- [The hocky stick controversy](https://web.archive.org/web/20031211211711/http://www.climate2003.com/file.issues.htm) Critics of the climate reconstruction by [Mann, Bradly and Hughes (1999)](http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/shared/research/ONLINE-PREPRINTS/Millennium/mbh99.pdf), made clear mistakes (in Excel) when trying to reproduce MBH's analyses.
- [Washington Post (2015)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/27/trouble-in-science-massive-effort-to-reproduce-100-experimental-results-succeeds-only-36-times/) Many scientific studies can't be replicated. That's a problem.
- [Challenges in irreproducible research](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552#) Collection of online _Nature_ articles devoted to reproducibility.
